# Zettlekasten
This is your personal knowledge management system based on the [zettlekasten]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)).

## Setup 

Folders: 
1. Journals: Contains one note per journal article with key information and concepts summarised as well as citation.
2. Concepts: These contain one note per concept. Multiple concepts can stem from one Journal note. The linking of ideas and notes are in the concepts directory.
3. Ideas: These are temporary thoughts that pop up. Also known as fleeting notes.
4. Writing: These are the new journals that you are writing. 
5. Templates: Contain the templates for journal notes and concept notes.


## Example Flow 

#### Article: *Improving Hospital Readmissions with Predictive Analytics*

1. **Journal Notes**:
   - "Model improved readmissions by 20%."
   - "Struggled with EHR data quality."
   - "Author mentions potential for ethical challenges."

2. **Concept Notes**:
   - **Title**: *Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmissions*
     - "Predictive models in the article reduce readmissions by 20%, but require high-quality data for accuracy."
     - **Source**: Smith et al. (2024), Journal of Healthcare Analytics.
   - **Title**: *Data Quality in EHR Systems*
     - "Poor data quality is a significant barrier to effective predictive modeling, as discussed in the article."
     - **Source**: Smith et al. (2024), Journal of Healthcare Analytics.

3. **Link Notes**:
   - Link *Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmissions* to *Data Quality in EHR Systems* to show the connection.

4. **Tag Notes**:
   - Tag both notes under "Predictive Analytics" and "Healthcare Data."

5. **Cite Source**:
   - Add full citation in your note to make it easier to reference later.

6. **Reflection/Questions**:
   - "How can data quality in EHRs be improved for more accurate models?"
   - Link this question to both the *Data Quality* and *Predictive Analytics* notes.
