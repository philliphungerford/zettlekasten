### 1. **Learning Rate**

- Controls how much the model's parameters are adjusted during training with each iteration. A high learning rate may lead to faster convergence but can cause instability, while a low rate may make training stable but slower.

### 2. **Number of Epochs**

- Defines the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model. More epochs allow for further training but increase the risk of overfitting.

### 3. **Batch Size**

- Determines the number of samples processed before updating the model's parameters. Smaller batch sizes may lead to more precise updates, while larger ones can reduce computation time but may result in less stable training.

### 4. **Regularization Parameters**

- Parameters like L1 or L2 regularization penalties are used to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. These help improve generalization.

### 5. **Dropout Rate (Optional)** 

- For neural networks, dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce overfitting. The dropout rate specifies the fraction of neurons to drop.

### 6. **Number of Layers and Neurons (Neural Networks)**

- Specifies the depth of the network and the number of units in each layer. More layers or neurons can increase model capacity but may lead to overfitting or higher computational costs.

### 7. **Kernel Type (SVM)**

- In Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the kernel function (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) determines how input data is transformed into higher dimensions.

### 8. **Tree Depth and Leaf Size (Tree-Based Models)**

- In models like decision trees, random forests, or gradient-boosted trees, maximum tree depth or minimum samples per leaf controls model complexity, affecting both accuracy and overfitting.

### 9. **Number of Estimators (Ensemble Models)**

- For ensemble methods like random forests and boosting algorithms, the number of estimators specifies the number of trees or models in the ensemble. Higher values can improve performance but increase computation.

### 10. **Activation Functions (Neural Networks)**

- Defines the non-linear function applied to each neuron. Examples include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Different activations affect learning dynamics.
	- **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): Mostly used in hidden layers due to its simplicity and efficiency. It helps to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.
	- **Sigmoid**: Used in binary classification outputs because it maps values between 0 and 1, making it useful for probability interpretation.
	- **Tanh**: Sometimes used in hidden layers, especially in RNNs, as it maps values between -1 and 1, centering data around zero.
	- **Softmax**: Typically used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems, where it provides probabilities for each class.

### 11. **Momentum (Optimization)**

- Used in gradient-based optimizers, momentum helps speed up training by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current one, which can help overcome local minima.
