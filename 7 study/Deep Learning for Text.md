Using machine learning and large datasets to give computers the ability to ingest a piece of language as input and return something useful like the following:

- [[text classification.canvas|text classification]] - "What is the topic of this text?"
- content filtering - "Does this text contain abuse?"
- sentiment analysis - "Does this text sound positive or negative?"
- language modeling - "What should be the next word in this incomplete sentence?"
- translation - "How would you say this in German?"
- summarisation - "How would you summarise this article in one paragraph?"
