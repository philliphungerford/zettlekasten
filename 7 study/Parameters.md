Parameters are the internal variables that a model learns from the data during the training process. They are adjusted by the learning algorithm to minimize the modelâ€™s loss or error, thereby improving the model's predictions. Parameters are found in almost all types of machine learning models, and their values are directly influenced by the data.

**Examples of Parameters in Neural Networks**:

- **Weights**: Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which is adjusted to learn patterns in the data.
- **Biases**: Each neuron has a bias term, which allows the model to better fit the data by shifting the activation function.
